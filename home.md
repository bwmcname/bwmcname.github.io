I'm Brian. This is the portfolio page I'm working on. I'm a game programmer. Currently I'm
playing Breath of the Wild, and Pokemon TCG.

Maybe you're reading this because you looked back in the commit history of this repository.
Or maybe I just forgot to update this page after I fell asleep the night that I'm writing this.
You should know before you make any serious character judgements, that I'm very tired.

Hey Brian, why are you tired?
Thats a good question. Its because I'm making two games right now with two jobs and
school. This page is to talk about said games and whatnot. When I look around me and see all
of the *cool kids*, my peers, I see they all have some form of this page. Here are the things
That I'm working on.

Right now I'm working on this indie game called Tori. Tori is about a bird that flies around and
collects things. Sometimes when you collect things you can bring them to other things, and
then magic(tm) happens. I work as a gameplay and graphics programmer on this game.

I'm also working on a game tentatively called **Branch For Your Life**.
Its an "infinite runner" game where you play as a little computer guy that jumps between
randomly generated branches to get as far as he can while trying to avoid obstacles.
I'm most proud of this game because I built the entire engine myself. All of the gameplay,
rendering, platform, etc ... code is all my own.

I'll have links to both of these projects soon.

Brian
