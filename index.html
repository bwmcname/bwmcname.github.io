<h1>Whaddup peeps</h1>

<p>I'm Brian. This is the portfolio page I'm working on.
Its pretty neat I guess, I'm not really into the whole web thing
so I don't really know what I'm doing. I kind of just want to
do some markdown so I was happy to see that github rendered markdown
automatically, but then I found out they inserted a weird header into
it and I was like nah. Its okay, I thought I was going to have to do it
all manually anyway.</p>

<p>Maybe you're reading this because you looked back in the commit history of this repository.
Or maybe I just forgot to update this page after I fell asleep the night that I'm writing this.
You should know before you make any serious character judgements, that I'm very tired.</p>

<p>Hey Brian, why are you tired?
Thats a good question. Its because I'm making two games right now with two jobs and
school. This page is to talk about said games and whatnot. When I look around me and see all
of the <em>cool kids</em>, my peers, I see they all have some form of this page. Here are the things
That I'm working on.</p>

<p>Right now I'm working on this indie game called Tori. Tori is about a bird that flies around and
collects things. Sometimes when you collect things you can bring them to other things, and
then magic(tm) happens. I work as a gameplay and graphics programmer on this game.</p>

<p>I'm also working on a game tentatively called <strong>Branch For Your Life</strong>.
Its an "infinite runner" game where you play as a little computer guy that jumps between
randomly generated branches to get as far as he can while trying to avoid obstacles.
I'm most proud of this game because I built the entire engine myself. All of the gameplay,
rendering, platform, etc ... code is all my own.</p>

<p>I'll have links to both of these projects soon.</p>

<p>Brian</p>
