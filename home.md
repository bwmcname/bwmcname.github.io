# Big header
## Less Big Header
### Even lesser header

I'm Brian. This is the portfolio page that I'm working on.
Its pretty neat I guess, I'm not really into the whole web thing
so I don't really know what I'm doing. Like I kind of just want to
do some markdown and I was happy to see that github rendered markdown
automatically, but then I found out that they inserted a weird header into
it and I was like nah. Its not too bad, I did it the way I thought I was going
to have to do it anyway.

Maybe you're reading this because you looked back in the commit history of this repository.
Or maybe I just forgot to update this page after I fell asleep the night that I'm writing this.
Its the current night for me but I'm sure that to you I'm speaking in the past. I'm really tired.

Hey Brian, why are you tired?
Thats a good question. It might be because I'm making two games right now with two jobs and
school. This page is to talk about said games and whatnot. When I look around me and see all
of the *cool kids*, my peers, I see that they all have some form of this. Here are the things
That I'm working on.

Right now I'm working on this indie game called Tori. Tori is about a bird that flies around and
collects things. Sometimes when you collect things you can bring them to other things, and
then magic(tm) happens. I work as a gameplay and graphics programmer on this game.

I'm also working on a game tentatively called **Branch For Your Life**.
Its an "infinite runner game where you play as a little computer guy that jumps between
randomly generated branches to get as far as he can while trying to avoid obstacles.
I'm most proud of this game because I built the entire engine by myself. All of the gameplay,
rendering, platform, etc ... code is all my own.

I'll have links to both of these projects soon.

Brian
